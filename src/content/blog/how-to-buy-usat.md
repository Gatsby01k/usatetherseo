## Step 1: Confirm where USAT is listed
Before you do anything:
- check exchanges you trust
- look for **real volume** (not just a ticker)
- verify the **contract address** for the chain you plan to use

**Rule:** never buy a token just because the name looks right.

## Step 2: Choose your route
### Route A: fiat → liquid stablecoin → USAT
1) deposit fiat
2) buy a liquid stablecoin (often USDT/USDC)
3) swap to USAT

### Route B: crypto → USAT
1) deposit crypto (BTC/ETH/USDT)
2) swap to USAT

## Step 3: Pick the right network
USAT may exist on multiple networks. Choose based on:
- where you will **use** it (wallet/app)
- fees (some networks are cheaper)
- withdrawal options on your exchange

## Step 4: Buy carefully
- use **limit orders** if liquidity is low
- check the order book depth
- avoid market orders in thin markets

## Step 5: Withdraw safely (optional)
If you withdraw to a wallet:
- double-check network selection
- send a small test transaction first

## Common mistakes
- wrong contract/token
- market order in low liquidity
- withdrawing on the wrong network
- ignoring withdrawal fees
