## At a glance
Both **USAT** and **USDT** aim to track **$1.00**, but the real differences show up in:

- **Liquidity** (how easy it is to buy/sell without slippage)
- **Availability** (which exchanges, which countries)
- **Controls** (freeze/blacklist features, issuer policies)
- **Fee routes** (deposit → trade → withdraw)

## Comparison table
| Feature | USAT | USDT |
|---|---|---|
| Market footprint | Often smaller / newer | Usually very large |
| Typical liquidity | Varies by venue | Generally high |
| Common use cases | Niche routes, specific venues | Trading pairs, transfers |
| Main risk | Liquidity + clarity | Issuer + regulatory context |

## Which one should you use?
Prefer the token with:
- better liquidity where *you* trade
- lower end-to-end fees (including withdrawals)
- policies and transparency you actually understand

### Practical tip
If the market is thin, use **limit orders** and avoid large market buys.

## Hidden costs people forget
- exchange withdrawal fees
- network fees
- spreads (thin books cost more than you think)
- bridging risks

## FAQ
### Can I swap USAT to USDT easily?
Only if your exchange lists both and the market is liquid.

### Are both “safe”?
No stablecoin is risk-free. Evaluate issuer policies and your jurisdiction.
