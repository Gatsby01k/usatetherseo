## Short Answer

USDT aims to maintain a $1 peg and remains one of the most liquid stablecoins globally.  
However, like any centralized stablecoin, it carries **issuer, reserve, regulatory, and control risks**.

This guide breaks them down clearly.

---

## What Is USDT?

USDT (Tether) is a USD-pegged stablecoin used primarily for:
- crypto trading pairs
- transfers between exchanges
- liquidity provision

It is not a bank deposit and does not offer government insurance.

## 1. Reserve Risk

USDT stability depends on:
- backing assets
- liquidity of reserves
- redemption systems

Key questions to evaluate:
- Are reserves audited or attested?
- What portion is cash vs other assets?
- How often are reports published?

If reserve transparency weakens, confidence drops — and price volatility can increase.

---

## 2. Depeg Risk

Even large stablecoins can temporarily trade below $1 during:
- market panic
- exchange insolvencies
- liquidity crunch

Short-term deviations don’t always mean collapse, but they signal stress.

---

## 3. Regulatory Risk

Stablecoin regulation continues evolving globally.

Risks include:
- restrictions in certain jurisdictions
- delistings from exchanges
- redemption limitations

Regulation can increase trust long-term but create short-term volatility.

---

## 4. Control & Freezing Risk

USDT is centrally issued.

This means:
- certain addresses can potentially be frozen
- blacklisting is technically possible

See: [Who Controls USDT?](/blog/who-controls-usdt/)

This is a tradeoff between compliance and decentralization.

---

## 5. Smart Contract & Network Risk

USDT exists on multiple networks (ERC20, TRC20, etc.)

Risks include:
- incorrect network withdrawal
- bridge exploits
- smart contract vulnerabilities

## Is USDT Safer Than USDC?

It depends on:
- transparency preferences
- liquidity needs
- exchange access

---

## Final Verdict

USDT is widely used and highly liquid.  
But it is not risk-free.

Use it as:
- a trading tool
- a transfer mechanism
- not as a long-term savings vehicle without diversification
