## Short answer

USAT aims to maintain a $1 peg, but like any stablecoin, it carries **issuer, liquidity, and regulatory risk**.

No stablecoin is risk-free.

---

## 1. Issuer Risk

Stablecoins depend on:
- reserve backing
- transparency
- redemption mechanisms

If backing is unclear or inaccessible, risk increases.

---

## 2. Liquidity Risk

Even if peg is $1 in theory, low liquidity can cause:
- slippage
- temporary price deviation

Always check trading volume before large transactions.

---

## 3. Regulatory Risk

Stablecoin rules differ by country.  
New laws can affect:
- redemption
- exchange listings
- user access

---

## 4. Smart Contract Risk

If USAT exists on-chain:
- contract bugs
- bridge vulnerabilities
- exploits

Always verify official contract addresses.

## FAQ
