## Why stablecoins exist
Stablecoins typically aim to:
- reduce volatility versus crypto assets
- make trading and transfers easier
- provide a “digital dollar” experience on blockchains

## How a stablecoin keeps its peg
Most USD stablecoins keep the peg using:
1) **Reserves / backing** (cash, cash equivalents, Treasuries, etc.)
2) **Redemption mechanisms** (authorized parties can redeem for USD)
3) **Exchange liquidity** (tight spreads reduce price drift)

If any of those weaken, the peg can wobble.

## What to verify before using USAT
Check:
- **Where it trades** (liquidity, volume, spreads)
- **Token contract** (correct address on the chain you use)
- **Controls** (freeze/blacklist/mint policies if applicable)
- **Fees** (withdrawal and network fees)

## Risks
- **Counterparty risk**: you rely on the issuer’s reserves and operations
- **Regulatory risk**: rules can change by country
- **Smart-contract risk**: if token contracts or bridges are exploited
- **Liquidity risk**: thin markets can cause slippage and de-pegs

## FAQ
### Is USAT the same as USDT?
No. They can differ in **issuance, liquidity, and venue availability**.

### Is USAT always $1?
It *aims* to be $1, but price can deviate in thin markets.

### Is this financial advice?
